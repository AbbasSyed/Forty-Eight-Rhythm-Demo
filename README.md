Forty-Eight-Rhythm-Demo
=======================
The official Android Developer's site recommends setting the width and height of each user interface component to a minimum of 48dp to make it easier for the user to touch the component across any device Screen Size.

The design below is implemented from the official Android site. This is an Android Studio project which I have made to demonstrate how to design such a Layout in XML. Note that width attribute of each nested LinearLayout is kept to a minimum of 48dp in height to maintain effective scalability and ease of touch responsiveness across varying screen densities and sizes.
